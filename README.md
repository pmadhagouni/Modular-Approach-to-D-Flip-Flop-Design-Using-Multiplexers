# Modular-Approach-to-D-Flip-Flop-Design-Using-Multiplexers
Designed a D Flip Flop using Swing Restored Pass–Transistor Logic and Lean integration with pass transistor (Single–rail pass
transistor logic).
• Used single-rail pass transistor logic to optimize circuit design, resulting reduced power consumption and improved performance.
• Employed swing restoration methods to maintain signal integrity and minimize voltage degradation in logic levels.
• Conducted extensive simulations using software tools (e.g., LTSpice, Cadence) to validate circuit functionality and timing
parameters.
